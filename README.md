# pickupAnalytics

"Pickup Analytics" is a data visualization from Thai government open data after I see some social discussion about new pickup truck model in 2020 from China.

Thailand is the second largest pickup truck market in the world after USA.
Statistic data indicated 45-50% of whole nation car license register on each year is pickup truck.

I had several question after some "automotive avatar" boast about this car model that this car 
must be the leader of pickup in Thailand. Does it can be true?

I downloaded 2018-2022 license register data from Department of Land Transport as .xlsx file.

Then I merged and transformed into well-shape for Power BI.
I also generated trendline-seasonal decomposition and found some insight.
Pickup truck can be categorized into 2 types, single/extended cab and double cab.
The best selling type of pickup truck in Thailand is single/extended cab.

This insight can be the best way for people who interested in this domain but doesn't enroll for job in this industrial.
Also, for car maker, if someone needs to develop new truck model, ev or ice, this insight may be a crue for opportunity.
